# TwinVECTOR Summer School 2025

_... to be added ..._

## How to use

Make sure that you correctly `cd` into the `twinvector-summerschool-2025` directory before running any commands,
especially if you've opened the overall repository.

```bash
uv sync
```

Then check the `asset_list.csv`. This is the only file that users should modify. It contains all assets that should be
added to the model.

Running (and inspecting) the code in `tryout.py` shows how that model could be used. This will further create an
exemplary plot and convert the model to a [https://app.diagrams.net/](https://app.diagrams.net/) (draw.io) sketch. This
can be opened inside VSCode too!

Using `Arrange > Horizontal Flow` works reasonably well to create an initial layout of the diagram.
